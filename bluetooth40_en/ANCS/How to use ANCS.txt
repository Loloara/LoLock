     HMSoft verion V524 added ANCS support (not include HMSensor version)
================================================================================

1. How to open ANCS function
  1.1 Please read apple notification ducument first.
  1.2 Send AT+TYPE3 command change to AUTH and BOND mode.
  1.3 Send AT+ANCS1 command to open ANCS.
  1.4 Send AT+PASS[para1] command to set passcode. Default passcode is "000000"
  1.5 Send AT+RESET to restart module.
  Now you can use LightBlue or our software to scan and made a connect with module.
  iOS will ask you input passcode. please input your passcode value.
  If all is okay,  you should receive AT+ANCS[para1] command from module UART.
2. About AT+ANCS[para1] command

       8: The length of the para1.
       0: EventID.
          EventIDNotificationAdded = 0,
          EventIDNotificationModified = 1,
          EventIDNotificationRemoved = 2,

          to retrieve more information about the iOS notification.
5. Get Notification Attributes
   AT+ANCS[para1][para2][para3]
   Format such as: AT+ANCS2345100
   para1: NotificationUID.
   Para2: NotificationAttributeID
          NotificationAttributeIDAppIdentifier = 0,

          NotificationAttributeIDSubtitle = 2, (Needs to be followed by a 2-bytes max length parameter)
          NotificationAttributeIDMessage = 3, (Needs to be followed by a 2-bytes max length parameter)
          NotificationAttributeIDMessageSize = 4,
          NotificationAttributeIDDate = 5,
          Reserved NotificationAttributeID values = 6¨C255
   Para3: max length parameter
          If para2 value is 0, 4, 5, para3 must set to "00"
